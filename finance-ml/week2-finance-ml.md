## Week 2 - Class Notes


### Devitations from Normality
+ Standard simplifying assumption: asset returns are normally distributed
+ Large changes are more common in reality --> normal distribution doesn't capture stock market
+ Higher Order Moments:
	+ Skewness: A measure of symmettry in the distribution
		+ negative skew --> Skews toward below the expected value or mean
		+ positive skew --> Skews toward above the expected value or mean
	+ Kurtosis: A measure of thickness of the tail of the distribution
