## Reviewing Lists in Python

### Useful Commands in Python for Statistical Analysis


import statistics as s
from statistics import mean 

s.mean(evens) // just computes the mean from the statistics library in python


range(5,10)[-1]



### Adding Lists Together

+ l1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
+ l2 = ['apple','banana','orange']
+ l3 = [3.4, 10, 'apple',[],[]]


+ l1 + l2 --> would include both the the string and other values from those lists.

- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'apple', 'banana', 'orange']
